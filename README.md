Ark is a development framework of intelligent operation which is implemented with an event-driven model. It proposes an intelligent operation engineering solution,to solve the following problems.

* no unified development model for operation and maintenance，the cost of development and maintenance is great and inefficient.
* pool extensibility, experience is difficult to reuse.

Ark provides the following functions to solve the above problems.

* a framework based on sensor,decision maker and executor.
* common development components.
* high-availability solutions.
